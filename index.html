    <h1>COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness</h1>
</header>

<main>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been among the most consequential public health efforts in modern history. Multiple vaccines have been developed using different technologies — but one of the most important questions remains: which COVID-19 vaccine is the “most effective”? To answer this, effectiveness must be defined in context (hospitalization, severe disease, death), and real-world data, not just clinical trial results, must be considered.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Vaccine Effectiveness</h2>
<p>
Vaccine effectiveness (VE) reflects how well a vaccine protects people in real-world settings, as opposed to efficacy from controlled clinical trials. Observational studies and meta-analyses provide key insights into how vaccines perform across populations, age groups, and over time.
</p>
<p>
For example, a broad meta-analysis found that COVID-19 vaccines overall showed very high real-world effectiveness: ~97.2% against hospitalization, ~97.4% against ICU admission, and ~99% against death. Within this landscape, the mRNA vaccines — particularly Moderna and Pfizer — have consistently stood out.
</p>

<h2>Evidence Favoring Moderna as the Most Effective</h2>

<h3>1. Real-World Hospitalization Protection</h3>
<p>
A CDC-led real-world study of more than 3,600 hospitalized adults across 21 U.S. hospitals (March–August 2021) reported that Moderna’s vaccine had a 93% effectiveness against COVID-19–related hospitalization. Pfizer’s vaccine measured 88%, and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) measured 71% in the same analysis.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study found that Pfizer’s effectiveness declined more over time, dropping from 91% in the first four months after vaccination to 77% afterward, while Moderna showed much more stable protection.
</p>

<h3>2. Strong Protection Among Older Adults</h3>
<p>
Among adults aged 65 and older, a report based on data from 13 U.S. states found that both mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) offered ≥91% effectiveness against COVID-19–associated hospitalization, while Janssen offered ≥84% effectiveness.
</p>

<h3>3. Meta-Analysis Support</h3>
<p>
A mini-review and meta-analysis covering many COVID-19 vaccines found that mRNA vaccines had the highest total efficacy and effectiveness compared to non-mRNA vaccines. Among these, Moderna showed the highest pooled effectiveness after the second dose (93%, 95% CI: 89%–97%).
</p>

<h3>4. Mortality Advantage and Durability</h3>
<p>
A study linking vaccination and mortality records in Milwaukee County found that for adults aged 60 and older, the risk of COVID-19-related death for Pfizer vaccine recipients was more than double that for Moderna recipients, largely due to Moderna’s slower waning of protection.
</p>

<h3>5. Economic and Public Health Impact of Updated Formulations</h3>
<p>
Modeling research on updated (fall 2023) Moderna vs. Pfizer formulations suggested that using Moderna’s updated vaccine would prevent significantly more infections and hospitalizations than Pfizer’s under certain scenarios.
</p>

<h2>Current (2024–2025) Context and Limitations</h2>
<p>
The 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine formulations used in the U.S. are based on the Omicron JN.1 lineage. According to current CDC guidance, there is no preferential recommendation for any authorized vaccine.
</p>
<p>
A recent CDC analysis (Sept 2024–Jan 2025) estimated that the 2024–2025 VE was only 33% against COVID-19-related emergency or urgent-care visits among adults, and 45–46% against hospitalization for immunocompetent adults aged 65+.
</p>
<p>
These findings highlight the challenges of waning immunity, evolving variants, and the need for updated booster formulations.
</p>

<h2>Interpretation and Implications</h2>
<p>
Moderna’s vaccine (mRNA-1273) shows very strong real-world effectiveness, particularly in preventing hospitalization, and appears to have more durable protection compared to Pfizer, especially in adults.
</p>
<p>
Pfizer’s vaccine (BNT162b2) also remains highly effective, especially shortly after vaccination, but may decline more rapidly over time. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine provides lower protection but still substantially reduces the risk of severe disease.
</p>
<p>
In the current paradigm of updated formulations targeting emerging variants, effectiveness gaps may shift over time. Individual risk, timing, and variant matching all play a growing role in determining which vaccine performs “best” at any given moment.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Based on available real-world data, Moderna has demonstrated some of the highest effectiveness among COVID-19 vaccines, especially in preventing hospitalization and maintaining protection over time. Meta-analyses and mortality-linked studies reinforce this. However, as formulations evolve and immunity wanes, vaccine effectiveness is dynamic — not static — and ongoing monitoring and updated boosters remain essential.
